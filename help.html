                <h2>How to setup Website</h2>
                <h3>Setup GitHub.</h3>
                <p>You will need a Github Account. Once you set it up, tell me your username and I can give you access to editing the website</p>
                <h3>Download Git</h3>
                <p>Download Git from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a>. You can use all the default settings when installing git</p>
                <h3>Cloning the repo</h3>
                <p>First, create the folder where you want to store the project files. Inside the folder, right click and click on the "open in terminal" button.<br>Then in your teriminal, use the following commands: <br><br>git init<br>git remote add origin https://github.com/Jeremy924/Jeremy924.github.io.git<br>git pull origin main<br>git checkout main<br><br></p>
                <h3>Editing the HTML</h3>
                <p>Just copy the formatting for the other html to add whatever you want. Ask ChatGPT to add images to the HTML. 
                    <br>To make the images accessible, just put them into the project folder. For your resume, you can also just put it in the folder, just make sure to change the link to be the name of the file.
                <br><b>Make sure you put everything in the /joshua folder within the project folder, otherwise it won't find any of the files</b> </p>
                <h3>Viewing the Website Locally</h3>
                <p>Open up your web browser, and type file:/// followed by the full file address for the project folder (ex. C:\Users\Jerem\...). Add /Joshua to view your portfolio</p>
                <h3>Pushing the Changes to the Public Website</h3>
                <p>Go back to the terminal, make sure it is in the project folder. Run the following commands. 
                    <b>Make sure you update the message for git commit so that it is something meaninful</b></b></p>
